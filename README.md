# Network-Topolgy-for-Zara-Pte.-Ltd.
Zara Pte Ltd is a well-known retail clothing company in Singapore. After 10 years of successful operation, the business suddenly hit a dead-end because their competitors, with their converged IP networks and IT savvy staff, were making more profits and operating at less cost. Having no choice but to jump into IT, they approach you, a Network consultant, to help them design a network that could support their business needs.
