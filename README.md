Zara Pte Ltd is a well-known retail clothing company in Singapore. After 10 years of successful operation, the business suddenly hit a dead-end because their competitors, with their converged IP networks and IT savvy staff, were making more profits and operating at less cost. Having no choice but to jump into IT, they approach you, a Network consultant, to help them design a network that could support their business needs.

The existing setup of Zara is as follows:
•	They have an office building in Jurong, their HQ office, and the staff strength here is the highest with 500 staff.
•	Total PCs recently bought to serve HQ needs
o	400 desktop PCs and 100 notebooks
•	The following are the number of staff on each floor
o	6th floor – HR Asia – 68 staff
o	5th floor – Finance Asia - 68 staff
o	4th floor – Marketing and Sales Asia – 134 staff
o	3rd floor – Product Management Asia – 100 staff
o	2nd floor – Product Research and Development Asia – 120 staff
o	1st floor – Reception and meeting room – 10 staff
 
Zara’s requirements as follows:

1.	They want an IP network to be created to interconnect all the departments at the HQ site. Appropriate VLSM was adopted, for the various departments.  The table of addresses are also given in the annex.

2.	Zara wants to be able to take online sales orders and thus they require a web server accessible by their internal departments. This web server would house their company website, their range of retail products and a shopping cart. (Design of shopping cart is not necessary, but a simple web page should be created). DNS needs to be implemented.

3.	Additional Security and Application features can be added in, such as

Password protection using administrative privileges
Login and attempts protection
SSH to access routers and switches
Email, FTP services (optional)
IPv6
